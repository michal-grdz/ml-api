All required packages are in "requirements.txt" file.

The jupyter notebook "model_selection.ipynb" contains a comparison between different models
and optimization of the algorithms input parameters K and L.

The chosen model is then trained in the "model_building.py" file. Trained ensemble models
are saved as well as the testing data.

To start the API execute "main.py". To generate model predictions upload 'test_data.csv' file.
